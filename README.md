a playground for practicing cpp programming and understanding particle behaviors

Hello friends!

I fell back in love with coding and am looking for another way to challenge myself. I do not promise "good"
code, but I hope to make some cool things relating to 3d renderings! Anyways, if you want to see my progress
over the next few years keep checking this page. I'll hold myself accountable as much as possible!
